# Obligatory Promise of Content
I'm going to try and write about some of the things I have been working and
thinking about here. Just trying to see how this layout works!

Lets see if code formatting works?
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char** argc) {
  std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

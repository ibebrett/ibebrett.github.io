# Reading Is Kind Of Worthless
I have spent a lot of time reading over the years. On the one hand, I feel like
sometimes it was great, and it can come in handy if I have read something that
ends up being useful in practice. However, 99% of the time reading about things
ends up satiating my appetite for doing something without actually going through
the steps of doing it.

It's harmful in the same way telling people you are on a diet is.
I end up feeling the satisfaction of accomplishment (or "understanding"),
without going through the process of actually putting it into place.

The gap between doing and reading about things is huge. Everything sounds simple
and easy on paper. The devil tends to be in the details. Also, I'm sure the
problems people actually run into when building something aren't the same ones
they envision going into the process. If they could predict the potential
issues most likely they would just avoid them. In this way, you don't gain much
information by just reading and thinking about things. You have to do DO them.

Anyway, just rambling. The main idea was to try and get some juices flowing for
actually posting content here.

# Obligatory Promise of Content
I'm going to try and write about some of the things I have been working and
thinking about here. Just trying to see how this layout works!

Lets see if code formatting works?
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char** argc) {
  std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
